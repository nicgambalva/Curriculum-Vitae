\clbody{
    The Global Sales and Marketing Bank Coverage Analyst role at J.P. Morgan is a strong fit with my interest in client coverage and market-driven reporting. I am drawn to a role that sits close to the desk, supports distribution and sourcing, and requires clear, timely communication with internal and external stakeholders. I bring an MSc in Financial Engineering from EDHEC and experience producing client-facing materials and market insights under tight deadlines.

    At Candriam, I supported liquid alternative funds as an Assistant Client Portfolio Manager. I monitored performance versus peers with Bloomberg and Python, prepared performance reports and client commentary, and automated recurring workflows to improve turnaround time and data consistency. This experience sharpened my ability to deliver concise messages to clients and to maintain accuracy in regular reporting.

    At TP ICAP, I worked on a quantitative equity research team building indicators to anticipate earnings results across 243 equities on 18 exchanges. I sourced and cleaned new datasets, tested our research against consensus expectations, and produced analyses that were shared with stakeholders under time pressure. The role required disciplined data handling, clear documentation, and the ability to summarize market information in a usable form.

    I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and comfortable working in fast-paced environments. I value teamwork and clear communication, and I am confident using Excel, PowerPoint, and Bloomberg to support the desk. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bank Coverage team in Paris and to grow within J.P. Morgan. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I would be glad to discuss my fit in an interview.

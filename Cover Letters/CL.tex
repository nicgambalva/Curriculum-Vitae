\clbody{
    I am writing to express my strong interest in the Equity Research Off-cycle Internship at J.P. Morgan in London. As a current MSc in Financial Engineering and MiM student at EDHEC Business School, I am passionate about equity markets and eager to contribute to your top-ranked Global Research franchise.

    My recent internship at TP ICAP as a Quantitative Equity Research Analyst gave me hands-on experience developing big data solutions for equity research. Working closely with the team, I built and automated quantitative models to identify investment opportunities and price discrepancies across a broad universe of listed equities. This role required strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate complex findings clearly, skills I am excited to bring to J.P. Morgan.

    My academic background has further strengthened my quantitative and financial expertise. At EDHEC, I have completed advanced courses in Financial Machine Learning, Quantitative Portfolio Management, and Advanced Derivatives and Trading, which have given me a solid foundation in financial modeling, data analysis, and the valuation of financial instruments. My experience at EY and PKF Arsilon also allowed me to develop and automate financial models, work with large databases, and produce clear, actionable research for institutional clients.

    I am highly motivated, detail-oriented, and thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments. I am confident in my ability to maintain and update valuation models, contribute to research publications, and communicate effectively with both internal and external stakeholders. My technical skills in Python, Excel, and financial databases such as Bloomberg and FactSet, combined with my passion for equity research, make me an excellent fit for this internship.

    I am particularly drawn to J.P. Morgan's commitment to innovation and excellence in equity research. The opportunity to work alongside industry leaders and contribute to high-impact research aligns perfectly with my career aspirations. I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to support J.P. Morgan's mission of delivering exceptional value to its clients. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and motivation align with the values and ambitions of J.P. Morgan.

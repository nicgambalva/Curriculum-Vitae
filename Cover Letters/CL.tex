\clbody{
    I am excited to apply for the internship at UBS within the Active Portfolio Advisory team. As a Master's degree student in Financial Engineering from EDHEC Business School, I have honed my quantitative skills and developed a deep understanding of financial markets.

    During my academic journey, I have acquired a solid foundation in quantitative methods and financial analysis. My recent experience as a Big Data Equity Research intern at TP ICAP allowed me to apply quantitative methods to analyze large datasets and identify investment opportunities. Working with a team that monitored over 240 equities across 18 stock exchanges, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis and quantitative research. My proficiency in Python, R, and VBA has been instrumental in developing tools and models that support data-driven decision-making. Besides this experience, I've also worked on valuation methods at PKF Arsilon and Data \& Analytics in Technology Consulting at EY, which were key experiences for developing both a passion for financial markets and technology with the aim of solving complex problems.

    I am particularly drawn to the responsibilities outlined in the job description, such as preparing morning meetings, producing cross-asset pitches, and conducting macroeconomic analysis for portfolio managers. The opportunity to participate in long-term projects like investment strategy committees and the automation of reporting processes is incredibly appealing to me. I am confident that my analytical abilities, attention to detail, and passion for financial research align well with the goals of your team.

    I am a very curious person, always eager to learn more and open to new challenges. I am particularly attracted to challenging tasks, which is one of the reasons why the dynamic and innovative environment at UBS captivates me. The possibility of working alongside experienced professionals in a global financial institution is exactly what I am looking for to further develop my skills and contribute meaningfully.

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to the success of UBS.

    I am excited to apply for the research internship at CFM focused on fundamental ratios. As a Master's degree student in Financial Economics from EDHEC Business School, I have honed my quantitative skills and developed a deep understanding of financial markets.

    Overtime fundamental ratios have been a key decision tool for many investors. I am interested in the quantitative approach to testing their robustness as predictors and extending the research of "Does Peer-Reviewed research Help Predict Stock Returns?". I am interested by this possibility and I believe it will be an enriching challenge.

    Beyond my academic background in Financial Engineering and Economics, where I have acquired a solid foundation in quantitative methods, I have gained practical experience in the financial industry. My recent experience as a Big Data Equity Research intern at TP ICAP allowed me to apply quantitative methods to analyze large datasets and identify investment opportunities. Working with a team that monitored over 240 equities across 18 stock exchanges, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis and quantitative research. My proficiency in Python, R, and VBA has been instrumental in developing tools and models that support data-driven decision-making. Besides this experience, I've also worked on valuation methods at PKF Arsilon and Data \& Analytics in Technology Consulting at EY, which were key experiences for developing both a passion for financial markets and technology with the aim of solving complex problems. 
    
    I am drawn to the development of systematic strategies and the possibility of working at a place with expertice across a broad range of asset classes and global markets like CFM. The opportunity to work alongside experienced quantitative researchers, strategists, and portfolio managers is incredibly appealing to me. I am confident that my analytical abilities, attention to detail, and passion for quantitative research align well with the goals of your team.

    I am a very curious person, always eager to learn more and open to new challenges. I am particularly attracted to challenging tasks, which is one of the reasons why cutting-edge quantitative research strategies captivate me. The dynamic and innovative environment at CFM is exactly what I am looking for to further develop my skills and contribute meaningfully.

    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to the success of WorldQuant.

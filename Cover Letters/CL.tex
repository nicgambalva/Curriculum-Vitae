    The quantitative strategist role at WorldQuant is exactly the kind of position where I can apply my quantitative training to systematic trading challenges. I am drawn to WorldQuant's research platform and the focus on building predictive signals and strategies at scale. I bring an MSc in Financial Engineering from EDHEC and hands-on experience building data-driven indicators and translating results into clear, actionable insights.

    At TP ICAP, I worked on a quantitative equity research team building indicators to anticipate earnings results across 243 equities on 18 exchanges. I sourced and cleaned new datasets, tested our research against consensus expectations, and reviewed results after each release to validate performance. The work required careful data handling, iterative model refinement, and disciplined evaluation, which aligns with alpha research and signal validation.

    At Candriam, I supported liquid alternative funds across equity market neutral, merger arbitrage, diversified futures, and multi-strategy. I monitored performance versus peers with Bloomberg and Python, produced client-facing reports, and automated recurring workflows to improve turnaround time and data consistency. This role strengthened my ability to explain performance drivers clearly and to build reliable tools for ongoing analysis.

    I am highly motivated, autonomous, and a fast learner who enjoys steep learning curves. I also value teamwork and clear communication, which are essential in a collaborative research environment. I am excited by WorldQuant's culture of accountability and continuous improvement and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your research and portfolio teams. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I would be glad to discuss my fit in an interview.
